	Planning an event can be overwhelming. You have to prepare food, find a venue, and coordinate with your guests. When you’re hosting, the food is a big concern. You don’t want to spend all day making food and then not have enough for your guests. You also don’t want to be stuck in the kitchen while everyone else is having a good time at your event.</p>

	Our catering service has years of experience with large parties like yours – we know how many people need to eat and what kind of food they’ll enjoy eating so that there will be plenty left over by the end of the event. We’ve optimized our preparation process so that everything comes out delicious every time without any hassle on your part!</p>
	</p>
	Let us handle cooking and preparing your event’s meals! Not only do we provide great tasting food but we bring it in buffet-style trays which allow your guests to easily serve when they start getting hungry instead of waiting around for someone else to bring it out or trying to get up from sitting down during dinner time. This allows you to be the best host at your events.</p>
	</p>
	Hire Flambeaux Restaurants as your catering company at your next event in Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area. We know how to please all kinds of palates and preferences while still maintaining high standards for our work product—which makes us ideal for corporate catering, weddings, daily office catering, holiday catering, special events, and other gatherings where things could get complicated if not done right! Whether you need vegetarian meals prepared by a chef who understands nutrition or delicious Caribbean food that brings the island to you, we can provide Great Food! Great Service! Every Time!</p>
	</p>
	CORPORATE CATERING</p>
	Running a successful business meeting or social gathering is hard.</p>
	Let us take care of the food, drinks, and setup for your event so you can focus on what matters – building relationships with potential clients. Our catering team will make sure that everything runs smoothly and that your guests are well fed. We’ll even clean up after ourselves when we’re done!</p>
	</p>
	Your staff can concentrate on doing what you hired them for – running an incredibly successful business meeting or social gathering without having to worry about anything but networking!</p>
	</p>
	Your guests will thank you for hiring us as your professional caterer too!</p>
	DAILY OFFICE CATERING</p>
	
	A Caribbean island flavour experience to get your office team rejuvenated without having to travel abroad for vacations. Most employees often grow bored of the food available in their corporate cafeteria, so our goal is to keep them coming back because of the island flavour experience we bring to your office. There is nothing better than being able to have a different kind of experience for your coworkers and they can stay energized at work.</p>
	</p>
	SPECIAL EVENT CATERING</p>
	Imagine the sweet smell of freshly cooked vegetables and succulent chicken filling your home while guests self-serve their plates. Or, maybe you’re picturing a rustic table set with china from generations past in front of an impressive backdrop as loved ones toast to the family gathered around it on this special day? Whatever vision is forming for you now, we’ve got just what’s needed to make that dream become reality! Everything with Caribbean island flavour and catering experience to your special event.</p>
	</p>
	WEDDING CATERING</p>
	We provide food and beverage to your wedding party. We will handle the work whichever venue you choose for your wedding. We can begin with an informal conversation that starts off without pressure so you can get a feel of what’s best for you. You’ll be able to either do it over the phone or in person depending on where you’re located.</p>
	</p>
	
	HOLIDAY CATERING</p>
	Planning a holiday party? Your guests will thank you for the great food. Whether it’s an intimate gathering of friends or family, hosting the perfect get-together requires careful consideration and attention to detail in all aspects – including what is served at your feast!</p>
	</p>
	Making sure everyone feels welcome and included (or figuring out if someone needs vegetarian options), takes a lot of planning. We can handle the heavy lifting for you. We make sure your guests feel special by being welcomed at your place with delicious flavours from the island.</p>
